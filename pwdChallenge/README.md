# pwdChallenge

I don't really know what is this... I decompiled this by error (misleading name, I just noticed that only after I finished working on this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
This is a more complicated one, even if it's a less secure program (load a password from a plain text file and just match it with the one in input).
I'm not sure how accurate the C code is, some points are not convincing me.
